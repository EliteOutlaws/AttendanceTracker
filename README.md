Raid Attendance Tracker
=======================

An experimental WoW attendance tracker I created for raids in 2007.

At the time we were using zero-sum DKP with complex attendance rules. Many players were joining and leaving mid-raid, and we wanted to correctly give points full & partial attendance. In addition, we needed to quickly know the DKP ranking by player class and tier when a loot event occured. This tool was used for about 3 months before we switched DKP systems.

It has some serious security issues (like the database password being in a text file in the webroot), but could easily be adapted to be less awful. Maybe i'll get around to it one day.
